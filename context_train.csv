1,1,Which of the following statements is true regarding the theories of relativity?,The theory of relativity only encompasses one theory by Albert Einstein.,Special relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature.,The theory of relativity does not encompass any theories by Albert Einstein.,"Special relativity applies to the cosmological and astrophysical domain, including the motion of planets, stars, and galaxies.",General relativity only applies to the motion of elementary particles and their interactions.,D,independence of the speed of light in vacuum from the motion of the source. These two principles were reconciled with each other by a re examination of the fundamental meanings of space and time intervals. The strength of special relativity lies in its use of simple basic principles including the invariance of the laws of physics under a shift of inertial reference frames and the invariance of the speed of light in vacuum. See also Lorentz covariance. It is possible to derive the form of the Lorentz transformations from the principle of relativity alone. Using only the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity one can show that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Galilean or Lorentzian. Whether the transformation is actually Galilean or Lorentzian must be determined with physical experiments. It is not possible to conclude that the speed of light c is invariant by mathematical logic alone. In the Lorentzian case one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and the constancy of the speed of light.Yaakov Friedman Physical Applications of Homogeneous Balls Progress in Mathematical Physics 40

Accompanying symptoms can include sensitivity to light and noise fatigue dizziness nausea and vomiting.

Diagnosis in sports  There are many diagnostic tools and tests within sports. While the tests and scales may vary greatly from sport to sport in the end they effectively gain the same information regardless. The first initial assessment that should take place with every athlete found to be unconscious after head or neck trauma is the ABCs airway breathing and circulation.

Because of the whiter and more natural light generated metalhalide lamps were initially preferred to the bluish mercury vapor lamps. With the introduction of specialized metalhalide mixtures metalhalide lamps are now available with a correlated color temperature from 3000 K to over 20000 K. Color temperature can vary slightly from lamp to lamp and this effect is noticeable in places where many lamps are used. Because the lamps color characteristics tend to change during lamps life color is measured after the bulb has been burned for 100 hours seasoned according to ANSI standards. Pulse start metal halide lamps have improved color rendering and provided a more controlled kelvin variance 100 to 200 kelvins. The color temperature of a metalhalide lamp can also be affected by the electrical characteristics of the electrical system powering the bulb and

Function  Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Two molecules of each of the four core histones H2A H2B H3 and H4 form an octamer around which approximately 146 bp of DNA is wrapped in repeating units called nucleosomes. The linker histone H1 interacts with linker DNA between nucleosomes and functions in the compaction of chromatin into higher order structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a member of the histone H4 family. Transcripts from this gene lack polyA tails but instead contain a palindromic termination element. This gene is found in the small histone gene cluster on chromosome 6p22p21.3. References Further reading

200,200,What property distinguishes cycloalkanes from alkenes in organic chemistry?,The type of hydrocarbon isomers,The number of carbon atoms in the structure,The presence of carbon-carbon double bonds,The presence of single carbon-carbon bonds,The arrangement of hydrogen and carbon atoms,D,In organic chemistry the cycloalkanes also called naphthenes but distinct from naphthalene are the monocyclic saturated hydrocarbons. In other words a cycloalkane consists only of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a structure containing a single ring possibly with side chains and all of the carbon carbon bonds are single. The larger cycloalkanes with more than 20 carbon atoms are typically called cycloparaffins. All cycloalkanes are isomers of alkenes. The cycloalkanes without side chains are classified as small cyclopropane and cyclobutane common cyclopentane cyclohexane and cycloheptane medium cyclooctane through cyclotridecane and large all the rest. Besides this standard definition by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry IUPAC in some authors usage the term cycloalkane includes also those saturated hydrocarbons that are polycyclic. In any case the general form of the chemical formula for cycloalkanes is CnH2n1r where n is the number of carbon atoms and r is the number of rings. The simpler form for cycloalkanes with only one ring is CnH2n.  Nomenclature  Unsubstituted cycloalkanes that contain a single ring in their

The first system developed on June 4 while the last storm dissipated on November 30. In 2012 as part of the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project meteorologists identified two previously unknown September tropical storms and finetuned the meteorological histories of many others. However given scant observations from ships and weather stations significant uncertainty of tropical cyclone tracks intensity and duration remains particularly for those storms that stayed at sea. In the United States the 1934 hurricane season was significantly less destructive than the preceding year.

Peripheral proteins dissociate following treatment with a polar reagent such as a solution with an elevated pH or high salt concentrations. Integral and peripheral proteins may be posttranslationally modified with added fatty acid diacylglycerol or prenyl chains or GPI glycosylphosphatidylinositol which may be anchored in the lipid bilayer. Polypeptide toxins Polypeptide toxins and many antibacterial peptides such as colicins or hemolysins and certain proteins involved in apoptosis are sometimes considered a separate category. These proteins are watersoluble but can aggregate and associate irreversibly with the lipid bilayer and become reversibly or irreversibly membraneassociated.  In genomes  Membrane proteins like soluble globular proteins fibrous proteins and disordered proteins are common. It is estimated that 2030 of all genes in most genomes encode for membrane proteins. For instance about 1000 of the 4200 proteins of E. coli are thought to be membrane proteins 600 of which have been experimentally verified to be membrane resident. In humans current thinking suggests that fully 30 of the genome encodes membrane proteins.  In

Green newly synthesized RNA strand by enzyme RNA polymerase II RNAP II and Pol II is a multiprotein complex that transcribes DNA into precursors of messenger RNA mRNA and most small nuclear RNA snRNA and microRNA. It is one of the three RNAP enzymes found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. A 550 kDa complex of 12 subunits RNAP II is the most studied type of RNA polymerase. A wide range of transcription factors are required for it to bind to upstream gene promoters and begin transcription.  Discovery  Early studies suggested a minimum of two RNAPs one which synthesized rRNA in the nucleolus and one which synthesized other RNA in the nucleoplasm part of the nucleus but outside the nucleolus. In 1969 science experimentalists Robert Roeder and William Rutter definitively discovered an additional RNAP that was responsible for transcription of some kind of RNA in the nucleoplasm. The finding was obtained by the use of ionexchange chromatography via DEAE coated Sephadex beads. The technique separated the enzymes by the order of the corresponding elutions  by increasing the concentration of ammonium sulfate.

Hans Knig was the first to identify and deduce the structure of ice Ic. The oxygen atoms in ice Ic are arranged in a diamond structure and is extremely similar to ice Ih having nearly identical densities and the same lattice constant along the hexagonal puckeredplanes. It forms at temperatures between upon cooling and can exist up to upon warming when it transforms into ice Ih. thumbPhase diagram of water Apart from forming from supercooled water ice Ic has also been reported to form from amorphous ice as well as from the highpressure ices II III and V. It can form in and is occasionally present in the upper atmosphere and is believed to be responsible for the observation of Scheiners halo a rare ring that occurs near 28 degrees from the Sun or the Moon.

390,390,What is the most common cause of tooth impaction?,Impacted teeth result from a lack of dental hygiene and inadequate oral care.,"Impacted teeth occur as a result of genetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal disorders.",Impacted teeth often happen due to adjacent teeth putting pressure on the tooth's path of eruption.,The excessive growth of soft tissue surrounding the tooth prevents proper eruption.,Dense overlying bone formation at the eruption site prevents the tooth from emerging.,C,can also present with tooth sensitivity in the associated areas. This occurs because as the abfraction lesions appear dentinecementum is exposed. The dentine and cementum are less dense than tooth enamel and therefore more susceptible to sensation from thermalmechanical sources.  Causes  As abfraction is still a controversial theory there are various ideas on what causes the lesions. Because of this controversy the true causes of abfraction also remain disputable.Antonelli JR Hottel TL GarciaGodoy F. Abfraction Lesions  Where do They Come From A Review of the Literature. J Tenn Dent Assoc. 2013 9311419 Researchers have proposed that abfraction is caused by forces on the tooth from the teeth touching together occlusal forces when chewing and swallowing. These lead to a concentration of stress and flexion at the area where the enamel and cementum meet CEJ. This theoretical stress concentration and flexion over time causes the bonds in the enamel of the tooth to break down and either fracture or be worn away from other stressors such as erosion or abrasion. The people who initially proposed the theory of abfraction believe the occlusal forces alone cause the

It is a very rare genetic disease. It is characterized by an elevated level of immunoglobulin D in the blood. Mevalonate kinase MVK is an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of cholesterols and isoprenoids and is necessary for the conversion of mevalonate to mevalonate5phosphate in the presence of Mg2. MKD is due to a mutation in the gene that encodes mevalonate kinase which results in a reduced or deficient activity of this enzyme. Because of this deficiency mevalonic acid can build up in the body with high levels found in the urine. The severity of MKD depends on the level of this deficiency with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome first described as HIDS in 1984 being less severe but more common and mevalonic aciduria MVA a more severe but rarer form.  Genetics  Mevalonate kinase deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner meaning that a child must inherit a defective copy of the gene from both parents to be affected. It is an example of a lossof function mutation. The gene which codes for mevalonate kinase

This scratching leaves soupplate depressions in the debris that are about 150 mm in diameter. The sideways sweeping action of the legs whilst foraging is unique to logrunners and is possible due to the distinctive structure of the logrunners pelvis and hind legs. The pelvis is short and broad and the femur is stout with strongly developed projections that support the attachment of the strong muscles needed to support its foraging technique. Logrunners are described as noisy birds with performances of loud songs and calls especially in the mornings. These songs and calls are believed to have either a territorial or sexual function. Diet The logrunner diet consists mainly of insects and other invertebrates uncovered via foraging on the forest floor. Social organisation and reproduction Logrunners live in pairs or in small groups and defend their territory aggressively from neighbouring birds. They are believed to form monogamous and permanent bonds. The female lays two eggs that are approximately in size. The eggs are white in colour and have an oval shape.

It is associated with a massive 10 solar masses protostar which accretes gas from a disk that surrounds it. IRAS 181622048 emits two collimated radio jets along its axis of rotation. The jets are made of chains of radio sources aligned in a southwestnortheast direction. The northern jet terminates in HerbigHaro object HH 81N while the southern one terminates in HerbigHaro objects HH 80 and HH 81. The total luminosity of IRAS 181622048 is about 17000 solar luminosities. The total extent of this system of jets and radio sources is about 5 pc. In 2010 HH 8081 jet of IRAS 181622048 were found to emit polarized radio waves which indicated that they were produced by relativistic electrons moving along the magnetic field estimated at 20 nT. This observation was the first of kind demonstrating that a protostar can have a magnetized jet.

ErlangOTP is supported and maintained by the Open Telecom Platform OTP product unit at Ericsson. History The name Erlang attributed to Bjarne Dcker has been presumed by those working on the telephony switches for whom the language was designed to be a reference to Danish mathematician and engineer Agner Krarup Erlang and a syllabic abbreviation of Ericsson Language. Erlang was designed with the aim of improving the development of telephony applications. The initial version of Erlang was implemented in Prolog and was influenced by the programming language PLEX used in earlier Ericsson exchanges. By 1988 Erlang had proven that it was suitable for prototyping telephone exchanges but the Prolog interpreter was far too slow. One group within Ericsson estimated that it would need to be 40 times faster to be suitable for production use.

Very unusually for medieval architecture the style is both at its most characteristic in secular buildings and the great majority of survivals are secular. The bestknown examples are the Doges Palace and the Ca dOro. Both feature loggias of closely spaced small columns with heavy tracery with quatrefoil openings above decoration along the roofline and some coloured patterning to plain wall surfaces. Together with the ogee arch capped with a relief ornament and ropework reliefs these are the most iconic characteristics of the style. Ecclesiastical Gothic architecture tended to be less distinctively Venetian and closer to that in the rest of Italy. The beginning of the style probably goes back no further than the 13th century although the dates of early Gothic palaces and especially features such as windows in them are largely uncertain. It dominated the 14th century and because of the citys conservatism Venetian
688,688,What distinguishes jadomycins from other angucyclines?,Jadomycin A is the first isolated compound of this family.,"Jadomycins are modified by glycosylation with a 2,6-dideoxy sugar.",Jadomycins are derived from an amino acid.,Jadomycins have cytotoxic and antibacterial properties.,Jadomycins are produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230.,C,A jadomycin is a natural product produced by Streptomyces venezuelae ISP5230 ATCC10712 the organism which is most well known for making the antibiotic chloramphenicol. The name jadomycin is applied to a family of related angucyclines which are distinguished by the E ring usually an oxoazolone ring which is derived from an amino acid. The amino acid incorporation which forms the Ering is a chemical reaction rather than enzymatic an uncommon occurrence in biosynthesis. As such a number of jadomycins incorporating different amino acids have been discovered. Jadomycin A was the first compound of this family to be isolated and constitutes the angucylic backbone with Lisoleucine incorporated into the Ering. A related analog jadomycin B is modified by glycosylation with a 26dideoxy sugar Ldigitoxose. Jadomycins have cytotoxic and antibacterial properties.  Biosynthesis  The jadomycin biosynthetic gene cluster is well characterized. Jadomycin biosynthesis encompasses type II polyketide synthase T2Pks assembly to generate the angucycline component and a dideoxy sugar pathway to generate the sugar donor NDPLdigitoxose. Studies have implicated JadG an FADdependent

Phycocyanobilin is present only in the phycobiliproteins allophycocyanin and phycocyanin of which it is the terminal acceptor of energy. It is covalently linked to these phycobiliproteins by a thioether bond. Phycocyanobilin PCB has the ability to bind to human serum albumin HSA protein found mainly in the blood of humans. This PCBHCA complex benefits the structure of HSA increasing the thermal stability of HSA as well as increasing its ability to prevent against proteolytic activity of other proteins.  Biosynthetic Pathway  The biosynthetic pathway of phycocyanobilin begins with 5Aminolevulinic acid 5ALA. Two molecules of 5ALA undergo a condensation reaction catalyzed by Porphobilinogen PBG Synthase to yield a molecule of Porphobilinogen PBG not shown. Four molecules of PBG are polymerized into a linear tetrapyrrole by Porphobilinogen deaminase. This reaction releases four ammonia molecules in the process. Completion of the tetrapyrrole is performed by Uroporphyrinogen III synthase

The six genera that make up the group Cantius Pelycodus Copelemur Hesperolemur Notharctus and Smilodectes contain species that are among the most primitive of the adapiform group which is one of the most primitive groups of primates. The evolutionary history of this subfamily has been comparatively well documented and has been used to argue for evolutionary gradualism. Though it is generally accepted that adapiforms gave rise to modern day lemurs and lorises it is not currently known which branch of Adapiformes these living species are most closely related to. Notharctines became extinct in the middle Eocene most likely because of a combination of factors including climatic change and competition with other North American primates. Taxonomic diversity Notharctinae is one of the two subfamilies along with Cercamoniinae of the Notharctidae family which is a member of the infraorder Adapiformes along with Adapidae and Sivaladapidae. Compared to other subfamilies the notharctines were not terribly diverse with only two or

Without the Higgs mechanism all bosons one of the two classes of particles the other being fermions would be considered massless but measurements show that the W W and Z0 bosons actually have relatively large masses of around 80 GeVc2. The Higgs field resolves this conundrum. The simplest description of the mechanism adds a quantum field the Higgs field which permeates all of space to the Standard Model. Below some extremely high temperature the field causes spontaneous symmetry breaking during interactions. The breaking of symmetry triggers the Higgs mechanism causing the bosons it interacts with to have mass. In the Standard Model the phrase Higgs mechanism refers specifically to the generation of masses for the W and Z weak gauge bosons through electroweak symmetry breaking. The Large Hadron Collider at CERN announced results consistent with the Higgs particle on 14 March 2013 making it extremely likely that the field or one like it exists and explaining how the Higgs mechanism takes place in nature.

978,978,What is the preferred winter roosting habitat for Savi's pipistrelle?,Old buildings,Underground vaults,Holes in trees,Bark,Rock crevices,B,feeds on flying insects which it catches on the wing using echolocation to locate its prey. It has been found that it synchronises the emittance of the ultrasonic sounds used for this purpose with its wing beats in order to maximise detection distances. It drinks by making repeated low flights over water raising its wings and scooping up water with its tongue. It may forage over pastureland in villages and round streetlights. Savis pipistrelle breeds in the summer and up to 70 female bats may roost together in maternity communities. Status Savis pipistrelle is listed as being of Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This is because its population is believed to be stable and there are no particular threats that affect it. Many nations protect all their bats and Savis pipistrelle is also protected through the Bonn Convention Eurobats in the countries that have ratified that treaty. It is also protected in Europe by its inclusion in Annex IV of the EU Habitats and Species Directive.

998,998,What type of star is LP Andromedae in the constellation Andromeda?,LP Andromedae is a red dwarf star.,LP Andromedae is a blue giant star.,LP Andromedae is a white dwarf star.,LP Andromedae is a neutron star.,LP Andromedae is a carbon star.,E,LP Andromedae often abbreviated to LP And is a carbon star in the constellation Andromeda. It is also a Mira variable whose mean apparent visual magnitude is 15.12 and has pulsations with an amplitude of 1.50 magnitudes and a period of 614 days. In 1974 LP Andromedae known then as IRC40540 was identified as a carbon star and also shown to be variable. It had previously been suspected of variability during the 2 Micron All Sky Survey 2MASS. A detailed study of its spectrum showed an unusually cool star with a basic class of C8 and Swan band strength of 3.5. It also showed strong C13 isotopic bands. The period was narrowed down to around 614 days one of the longest periods known for a Mira variable. This star has a dusty envelope with an estimated mass of 3.2  fueled by the star itself which is losing mass at a rate 1.9 yr. Such a high mass loss rate should place LP Andromedae close to the end of its asymptotic giant branch evolution. The envelope extends to a distance of 3 parsec from the star and is mainly made of silicon carbide and carbon particles.
